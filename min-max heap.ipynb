        "    * After the comparason between the new node and its parent, we stil need to verify the validity of the position of the new node, which means every node have to be the minimum/maximum among its subtree after the insertion.\n",
        "    * So, here comes the way to check it. Since we know, except for the parent/grandparent of the new nodes, the validity of others won't change, hence, we only need to check if its grandparent valid after the adjustment with its parent. Take a look of the function *verifyMin* and *verifyMax* in the following code. it check the grandparent of the node recusively. If the node is smaller than the grandparent in the min level, exchange them. Same thought that, if the new node is larger than its grandparent in the max level, change it and vice versa.\n",
